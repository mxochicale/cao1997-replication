## TODO

* [ ] replicate Figure 1 using `plotE1E2` in `cao97_functions`
(added:28march2018, sorted:?)



* [ ] fix the factor(tau) label in `cao97_funtions.R`

```
plotE1taus <- function(E) {
	#labs(fill='title')+
	#guides(color=guide_legend(title='ass'))+

```

* [ ] time of computation of E values for noise time series is taking a lot of time.
	revise the reason of that and make a simple example.

* [ ] For the scripts: Start your code indicating authorship, last update, and contact info and provide an outline of the code 
structure and through the code use the same numbers so people can naviage the code easily. 
Comment the code every three lines. Learn more at: http://datacolada.org/69

* [ ] create a list for the `R` depencies for either packages or gnu/linux libraries

(added:8march2351, sorted:?)



## SORTED

* [x] integrate each of the plots for E values into the function `cao97_functions.R`
	(added:16march2018 0143; sorted:27march2018)


* [x] `examples/helloworld/example-cao97.R` has been created, however the code has to be cleaned 
and use as little dependencies as possible  
(added:9march0019, sorted:27march2018)



* [x] implementation of computation of E values and plots for `~/examples` (added:9march2018, sorted:16march2018)
