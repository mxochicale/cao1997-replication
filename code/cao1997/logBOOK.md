and use little dependencies  

(added:9march0019, sorted:?)



* [ ] For the scripts: Start your code indicating authorship, last update, and contact info and provide an outline of the code 
structure and through the code use the same numbers so people can naviage the code easily. 
Comment the code every three lines. Learn more at: http://datacolada.org/69
