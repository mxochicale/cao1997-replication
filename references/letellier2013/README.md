Estimating the minimum embedding dimension
---

Christophe LETELLIER in April 2013 made the fortran implementation
of estimation of mimimum embedding dimension available.

Learn more about the implementation at http://www.atomosyd.net/spip.php?article128 
and download the fortran code at http://www.atomosyd.net/spip.php?action=dw2_out&id=428

If you use the code, cite Liangyue Cao's paper and I would say that you have
to also thank Letellier for his fortran implementation.
