## Abstract
A practical method is proposed to determine the minimum embedding dimension 
from a scalar time series. It has the following advantages: 
(1) does not contain any subjective parameters except for the time-delay for the embedding; 
(2) does not strongly depend on how many data points are available; 
(3) can clearly distinguish deterministic signals from stochastic signals; 
(4) works well for time series from high-dimensional attractors; 
(5) is computationally efficient. Several time series are tested to show the above 
advantages of the method.
